This blog is all about our journey and the challenges we faced while building the project.


What was our problem statement and how did I approach it:-
So we had a problem statement that we have to create a clone of a website called groww.com .<br>
Also, We can only use my HTML, CSS, and core JavaScript knowledge. We were five members in our group.

How We divided the work in our Team members:-
<hr>
As we were five members in our team so it was very important to decide how we will approach the work so that

in the future we should not face any problem in merging the code, as well as the tasks, get divided into equal

parts.So, on the first day, As a team leader, I made a git repository and everyone was told to make their separate

git branch by cloning the repo and push their work there and when they feel that they have completed it.They can show

it to one of the members(team leader) and after the approval, they can merge their code to the main branch.I was mainly

responsible for making the Product page and navigation bar and script part which are similar on all the pages.

And my other team members were responsible for the login page, landing page, and Cart page and make the page look better.
